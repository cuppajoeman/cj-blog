Today I will give a reference table for standard chords including jazz chords.
To be able to construct these quickly we will explain what the notation means:

Some of the notation uses numbers, like X^9, these represent scale degrees of a
standard major scale:

| scale degrees | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| intervals     | 0 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11| 0 |

continuing to go further yields

| scale degrees | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| intervals     | 0 | 2  | 4  | 5  | 7  | 9  | 11 | 0  |

Also note that for the symbol X9, we can see it uses the intervals 0 2 4 7 10,
so it's a combination of X7 plus the 9th (remember 9th is the interval 2 based
on the tables above). Also note that for  X13 we have the intervals  
0 2 4 5 7 9 10 so it's combining X9 with the 13th scale degree. In practice we
don't need to play all those notes at once to get the idea of X13 across, in
general we can remove intervals which represent simple harmonics (being a
harmonic means that it is very similar to the root tone), so it can be
simplified to 0 2 5 9 10 (there are other options).

So when we have a chord with a number after it, it specifies all notes up to
that N should be added (like in the X13 example above), but if we wrote Xadd11
for example we would just add the 11th scale degree and not everything up until
the 11th scale degree so it would be 0 4 7 5.

Here is the table of all of the chords:

| Chord Symbol                                    | Semitones Above|

| X2                                              | 0 2 7          |
