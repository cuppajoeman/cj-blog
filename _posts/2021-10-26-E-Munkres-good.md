## A Good version of Electronic Munkres

I located a version of munkres which had no TOC (but is a re-latex'd pdf) and I used following my post about adding custom TOC's to books {% post_url 2021-10-26-toccing-about-tocs %} to improve the table of contents, you can download it [here](munkres topology.pdf)
